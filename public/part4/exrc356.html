                            Basicly, both ng-show/hide and ng-if server for same porpuse. The differens is while ng-show only hides the element, ng-if
                            actually removes it from the scope. Using ng-if should give better performance most of the time,
                            if massive elements are being loaded to the DOM though not needed.

                            <strong>Compile :</strong>
                            <br>This is the phase where Angular actually compiles your directive.
                            <br>This compile function is called just once for each references to the given directive.
                            <br>For example, say you are using the ng-repeat directive. ng-repeat will have to look
                            <br>up the element it is attached to, extract the html fragment that it is attached to and
                            <br>create a template function.
                            <br>
                            <br>If you have used HandleBars, underscore templates or equivalent,
                            <br>its like compiling their templates to extract out a template function.
                            <br>To this template function you pass data and the return value of that function is the html
                            <br>with the data in the right places.
                            <br>
                            <br>The compilation phase is that step in Angular which returns the template function.
                            <br>This template function in angular is called the linking function.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>Linking phase :</strong>
                            <br>
                            <br>The linking phase is where you attach the data ( $scope ) to the linking
                            <br>function and it should return you the linked html. Since the directive also specifies
                            <br>where this html goes or what it changes, it is already good to go.
                            <br>This is the function where you want to make changes to the linked html,
                            <br>i.e the html that already has the data attached to it.
                            <br>In angular if you write code in the linking function its generally the post-link function (by
                            default).
                            <br>It is kind of a callback that gets called after the linking function has linked the data with
                            the template.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>Controller :</strong>
                            <br>
                            <br>The controller is a place where you put in some directive specific logic.
                            <br>This logic can go into the linking function as well, but then you
                            <br>would have to put that logic on the scope to make it "shareable".
                            <br>The problem with that is that you would then be corrupting the scope with your directives
                            <br>stuff which is not really something that is expected. So what is the alternative
                            <br>if two Directives want to talk to each other / co-operate with each other?
                            <br>Ofcourse you could put all that logic into a service and then make both these directives depend
                            <br>on that service but that just brings in one more dependency.
                            <br>The alternative is to provide a Controller for this scope ( usually isolate scope ? )
                            <br>and then this controller is injected into another directive when that
                            <br>directive "requires" the other one. See tabs and panes on the first page of angularjs.org for
                            an example.

                            <strong>@ or @attr</strong> - bind a local scope property to the value of DOM attribute (one way binding).
                            <br><strong>= or =attr</strong> - set up a bidirectional binding between a local scope property and an expression
                            passed via the attribute attr (two way binding).
                            <br><strong>& or &attr</strong> - provides a way to execute an expression in the context of the parent scope (function
                            binding).
