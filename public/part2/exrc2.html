        <p>
            The $scope.watch() function creates a watch of some variable. </br>
            It takes two arguments (value function, listener function). </br>
            From this moment on, the watch will "watch over" the value, if it was changed, it will triger whatever listener function
            set to deal with it.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="tab-pane fade" id="digest">
        <p>
            tl;dr
            <br> digest() activates all watch() functions in the scope.
            <br>
            <br> The $scope.$digest() function iterates through all the watches in the $scope object,
            <br> and its child $scope objects (if it has any).
            <br> When $digest() iterates over the watches, it calls the value function for each watch.
            <br> If the value returned by the value function is different than the value it returned the last time it was called,
            <br> the listener function for that watch is called.
            <br>
            <br> The $scope.$digest() function is being called by AngularJS in times it thinks it should,
            <br> for example after button handler executed or AJAX call returns.
            <br> Yet there might be few usecases in which we it won't be activated and we should do it manually.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="tab-pane fade" id="apply">
        <p>
            The $scope.$apply() function takes a function as parameter which is executed,
            <br> and after that $scope.$digest() is called internally.
            <br> That makes it easier for you to make sure that all watches are checked, and thus all data bindings refreshed.
